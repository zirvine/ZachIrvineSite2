        <h3>IS 413 Objectives</h3>
        <p>In this semester, I would like to be able to do full stack development more confidently. </p>
        <p>When I have done web development in the past, I feel like I'm not solving a problem, but I am</p>
        <p>put into situations where I either need to remember the syntax or all the lines of code that need to</p>
        <p>go into every folder. I am also terrible at front end development, so I am excited to learn</p>
        <p>more about React, and I hope that can fix my problems.</p>
